# top-calculator

Very very simple little calcuialtro web app! It was actually kind of surprising how hard it was to code! I tried doing some "smart" things, but I think it ended up with code that looks way worse than if I had just used 500 if statements. 

Some bugs: I don't know of any currently. They do exist though. There are fringe cases and inputs that will break this, that I have yet to try.

The calculator works similarly to how a real simple calculator would, and not how a smarter calculator like the ones on your phone do. This means that there are a lot of missing QoL features, but it makes my job easier and you aren't going to use this anyways so, don't complain. 

Yes the css looks bad.
